## librespot-golang

### Introduction

librespot-golang is an opensource Golang library based on the [librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot) project, allowing you to control Spotify Connect devices, get metadata, and play music. It has itself been based on [SpotControl](https://github.com/badfortrains/spotcontrol), and its main goal is to provide a suitable replacement wfor the defunct libspotify.

This is still highly experimental and in development. Do not use it in production projects yet, as the API is incomplete and subject to heavy changes.

This fork contains changes that are more compatible with go.mod, while removing the Rust-esque package layout. It has not been tested thoroughly, though things do compile. Please open an issue if anything is broken.

### Installation

This package can be installed using:

```sh
go get github.com/librespot-org/librespot-golang/librespot
```

### Usage

To use the package look at the example micro-controller (for Spotify Connect). For the CLI, install the main package:

```sh
go get -u github.com/librespot-org/librespot-golang
```

### Building for mobile

The package `librespotmobile` contains bindings suitable for use with Gomobile, which lets you use a subset of the librespot library on Android and iOS.

To get started, install gomobile, and simply run (for Android):

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/librespot-org/librespot-golang
gomobile init -ndk /path/to/android-ndk
gomobile bind librespotmobile
```

This will build you a file called `librespotmobile.aar` which you can include in your Android Studio project.

### Compiling on nix:

```sh
nix-shell -p gcc pkgconfig libvorbis libogg portaudio
```

### To-Do's

- Handling disconnections, timeouts, etc (overall failure tolerance)
- Playlist management
- Spotify Radio support
